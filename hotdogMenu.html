        <li><strong>Char-Grilled Maxwell Street Polish Sausage</strong><br>Maxwell St. in Chicago is where this style of Polish sausage was born more than 75 years ago. Our founder, Dick Portillo, frequented the famous corner of Maxwell St. & Halsted St. as a young boy, where he recalls the sweet smell of grilled onions from the Polish sausage street carts. Dick brought the Maxwell St. Polish to the menu so everyone could enjoy the taste of Maxwell Street at Portillo’s. The Portillo’s Maxwell St. Polish is a Makowski’s Real Sausage, grilled to perfection, and topped with lots of yellow mustard and sliced grilled onions.</li>
        <li><strong>Char-Grilled Polish Sausage</strong><br>Char-grilled polish sausage, made like our Chicago-style hot dog with everything, includes mustard, celery salt, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripe tomatoes, kosher pickle, and sport peppers piled onto a steamed poppy seed bun.</li>
