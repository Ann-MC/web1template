    <h1>Portillo's</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>In 1963, Dick Portillo invested $1,100 into a small trailer to open the first Portillo's hot dog stand in Villa Park, IL, which he called "The Dog House." Years later, Portillo's has become a brand synonymous with Chicago. In fact, we're kind of a big dill- people say it's not a real trip to Chicago unless you eat at Portillo's. Fortunately, die-hard fans and first-timers alike have their choice of Portillo's restaurants, as we've beefed up to more than 70 locations across several states.</p>
