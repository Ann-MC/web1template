    <h2>Hot Dogs</h2>

        <li><strong>Hot Dog</strong><br>Chicago-style hot dog with everything, which includes mustard, relish, celery salt, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripe tomatoes, kosher pickle and sport peppers piled onto a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun. Chicagoans call this “dragging the dog through the garden.”</li>
        <li><strong>Plant-Based Garden Dog</strong><br>Portillo's new plant-based hot dog made with 100% plant-based protein and crafted for Portillo's by Field Roast. It comes with everything, which includes mustard, relish, celery salt, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripe tomatoes, kosher pickle and sport peppers piled onto a perfectly steamed poppy seed bun.</li>
        <li><strong>Chili Cheese Dog</strong><br>Hot dog served with American cheese and topped with chili and chopped onions.</li>
        <li><strong>Char-Grilled Maxwell Street Polish Sausage</strong><br>Maxwell St. in Chicago is where this style of Polish sausage was born more than 75 years ago. Our founder, Dick Portillo, frequented the famous corner of Maxwell St. & Halsted St. as a young boy, where he recalls the sweet smell of grilled onions from the Polish sausage street carts. Dick brought the Maxwell St. Polish to the menu so everyone could enjoy the taste of Maxwell Street at Portillo’s. The Portillo’s Maxwell St. Polish is a Makowski’s Real Sausage, grilled to perfection, and topped with lots of yellow mustard and sliced grilled onions.</li>
        <li><strong>Char-Grilled Polish Sausage</strong><br>Char-grilled polish sausage, made like our Chicago-style hot dog with everything, includes mustard, celery salt, freshly chopped onions, sliced red ripe tomatoes, kosher pickle, and sport peppers piled onto a steamed poppy seed bun.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Beef & Sausage Sandwiches</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Italian Beef Sandwich</strong><br>Our famous, homemade, Italian beef is slow-roasted for four hours, thinly sliced, and served on freshly baked Turano French bread. There are many ways to order an Italian beef sandwich. The standard sandwich is served by splashing a bit of our flavorful, secretly-spiced gravy on it. Some like their sandwich “dipped,” which means we dip the whole sandwich in our gravy. You can also order it “dry,” with very little gravy. Why do we call it gravy? Because it’s actual gravy, just like grandma used to serve: We use the beef’s natural gravy that comes off of it while roasting for four hours. Our Italian beef sandwiches taste best topped with our homemade, oven-roasted sweet peppers or hot giardiniera peppers.</li>
        <li><strong>Big Beef Sandwich</strong><br>50% bigger than our regular beef sandwich, served on perfectly baked French bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Italian Beef & Sausage Combo</strong><br>This power couple consists of one char-grilled, flavorful Italian pork sausage topped with our homemade, slow-roasted Italian beef on freshly baked Turano French bread. Top it with our homemade, oven-roasted sweet peppers or hot giardiniera peppers for a powerful flavor combination!</li>
        <li><strong>Big Beef Combo</strong><br>50% bigger than our regular combo sandwich: A char-grilled sausage and Chicago's #1 beef served together on perfectly baked French bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Char-Grilled Italian Sausage Sandwich</strong><br>Our char-grilled, flavorful Italian pork sausage recipe has been around for over a decade. It was made just for Portillo’s using secret spices, and it tastes best topped with our homemade, oven-roasted sweet peppers or hot giardiniera peppers. Served on freshly baked Turano French bread.</li>
        <li><strong>Beef-n-Cheddar Croissant</strong><br>A combination of our famous Italian beef layered with cheddar cheese and served on a toasted croissant.</li>
